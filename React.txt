# @desc The promises only fire one, => pub/sub handle not with this
# @tag infomation
Because promises only fire once. A promise is created/initialized, and then settled, and once settled can never be un-settled or re-settled.

So for what that code is doing, a promise isn't the right tool. => event emitter, or pub/sub
